                <h4>
                    If God is almighty, why did christain(bible)
                    say he live's in heavenand have a son?. Almighty
                    is what you can't decribe or something you don't
                    know the beging and the end's. Talking about God,
                    is out of faith, that while bible say no one can
                    see God without faith, faith is all about imagination
                    (when you pray, you communicate with God; when you
                    meditate God spake to you.). Gen chapter 1 is talking
                    about imagination of God while chapter 2 is talking
                    about the physcial creation, because you must imagin
                    before you create.
                </h4><br>
                <h4>
                    Faith is the process of forming ideas or beliefs
                    without empirical evidence, evidence something you
                    have not seen. If you beliefs in your imagination
                    and start working on it, it will come to physcail
                    exitance, because faith without work is dead according
                    to(james 2:14-19). God created us out of imagination,
                    whice is faith, that while he give us domion of all
                    everything in the world. We become human. Human came
                    from latain word/ HU means goddly while MAN become
                    living bein. Once you have the ability to create you
                    become the God of yourself(GEN 1:20-30). The so called
                    gardin of eden is talking about law of nature, if you
                    don't put raw martrial in work it will not exist(faith
                    without work) so what ever you belief will favour you.

                    Pure law of reciprocality what goes around comes
                    around, man die, man will still come back to earth.That
                    is our Africa faith before coming of the white, that is
                    my belief(jesus say i'm coming back again)In the bible
                    when jesus ask his discpiles whom did you think i'm?
                    the where talking about the prohnet who have die thousand
                    years ago before jesus, that jesus is isaiah, elishai etc
                    to tell you that the disciple belives in law of reciprocality.
                    In this lif change is constant, that while i said heaven or
                    hell-fire does not exist, the exist here on earth(poverty is
                    the hell-fire while rich wealth is your heaven) The worse sin
                    man will commite is poverty, that while you hear about the
                    richest pastor or the richest church. Accident or Miracle
                    does not exit here on nature(LIFE) That why Nature tell you
                    what so ever you sole that you will rep, Nature is God
                    according to oxford dictionary (law of gravity what goes up
                    must surely comes down.

                <h4>
                    Idol is an graven image or representation of anything
                    that is revered or believed to convey spiritual power.
                    according to cambridge dictionary idol is a person who is
                    loved, admired or respected a lot, an idol is also a object
                    or picture. Let come back again to faith, the opposition of
                    faith is fear, because what so ever you are afriad of will
                    automatically comes alive{FEAR}: Force Evidence Appering Real,
                    Once you put fear it will come to physcail existance and start
                    working against you, because everything been created on earth
                    is Postive and Negative. You as a human your business here is to
                    imagin or dream weather it's possible or not is not your business is business of
                    NATURE, that bible say what so ever man thinket so shall it be.
                    No one can see God without faith(imagination).

                    IDOL will be like your drawing board that remains you about your thougt and your faith "Jesus
                    christ, Bible, picture of saints and alter is an IDOL because is what you admired, respected and
                    belived, anybody talking about Jesus is saying it out of imagention because the apostle of jesus
                    started preching the gosple when left the earth and nower days pastors are preching the gosple out
                    of imagention. Jesus is an idol because is what you respected alot. Anything you mode or carve in a
                    status and started beliving that it will solve your problem, With chukwuabiama everything is
                    possible. Let go to old tersterment when isreality where in the witerness and snake was biting them,
                    God instruted moses to carve an image of snake or something like that and place it high, whom ever
                    that look onto it shall be heal, that is the power of idol and the work of status.

                        This is the four elements of Life or Creation.
                        The christian called it the four Archangel (Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel ).
                        In our land the four Archangel are:(EKE, ORIE, AFO, NKWO).
                        Natural the are (WATER, EARTH, FIRE, AIR)..

                        *Mika’il – The Angel Mika’il (known as Michael in Christianity) is a
                        friend to humanity. He is known as the giver of rain, which waters
                        the land and helps to provide food for people. He is believed to guard
                        places of worship and reward people’s good deeds. As the Angel of Mercy,
                        he asks Allah to forgive people’s sins. It is believed that both the Angel
                        Jibril and the Angel Mika’il will be present on the Day of Judgement.

                    <h4>
                        Izra’il – The Angel of Death, who takes the souls from bodies when people die.

                    <h4>
                        Munkar and Nakir – The angels responsible for questioning the soul of a person who has died.

                    <h4>
                        Angels communicate with Allah and humans to ensure the direct word of Allah is given to humans
                        correctly.

                    <h4>
                        Muslims also believe that angels are with them at all times. They have two angels,
                        which sit on either shoulder and are known as Al-Kiram and Al-Katibun. One of the
                        angels records the good things the person has done and the other records the bad
                        things the person has done. Allah will judge each person based on these deeds, deciding
                        whether they are worth of Paradise (Jannah or Hell (Jahannam).

                        {(Archangels (/ˌɑːrkˈeɪndʒəl/) are the second lowest rank of angel in
                        the hierarchy of angels. A common misconception is that archangels are the highest rank of
                        angel,
                        this misconception stems from John Milton's Paradise Lost and likely confusion with the Greek
                        prefix
                        "arch-" meaning "chief". The word archangel itself is usually associated with the Abrahamic
                        religions,
                        but beings that are very similar to archangels are found in a number of other religious
                        traditions.
                        Archangels also appear in the religious texts of Gnosticism.[1][2]

                        The difference between ABRAHAMIC RELIGIONS and AFRICA RELIGION is that; ABRAHAMIC write ✍️ there
                        own down, meanwhile our ancestors pass there own through folk-tales (AKUKO-IFO); That why a says
                        say if you want to hide something from a black Man (Africa) write it down. That why if we sleep
                        we dreams. That Dream is telling you about your future or your past, because before you leave
                        you got to die, and before you die you got to leave, without Death Life Will not have value,
                        without Dark 🌑 light will not have values, without negative, positive can't work.. that why
                        every souls coming to Earth, came with a mission been agree by his Chi (God) and his karma. "
                        "To me karma take record of every second of your life. Through what you say, what you do, what
                        you see, what you feel ETC.. <br>
                        That why forgiveness does not exist in nature, mercy doesn't exist in nature. That why it say
                        you must reap what you sow" ".
                        The four Archangel (four faces of God) has only one God which "ALMIGHTY" this information I am

                        ‌I started this my information (mission) from where I stopped from the past, to add it value in
                        the future. In our land this ALMIGHTY is called chukwuabiama "an endless one". Know Africa
                        listen ONLY YOUR ANCESTORS CAN CONNECT YOU TO THE ALMIGHTY. Which is the four ARCHANGELS (EKE,
                        ORIE, AFO, NKWO) In our land that is the our ancient Days of the week.
                        from this our Days of weeks, everyday has own spirit (Angel) that is in charge of it, Life begin
                        in Africa, the sun rises from East which also Africa,
                        Africans are ancient people with there own way of life. Also in MY LAND (IGBO) there is a
                        village inside Arochukwu; called IHE CHI UWA, which means, light of God on earth, where the
                        light of God first shine, the light of hope and Life.
                        Now let me exposed the lie about Lucifer.
                        Lucifer has been in the English language for a very long time, and has not solely carried the
                        meaning of "Satan." The word comes from a Latin root—lucifer, in Latin, means
                        "light-bearing"—and has also been used by poets to refer to Venus, the morning star.
                        This what christian called bible have been written in many languages, and Latin was third before
                        English conquer everything still Now,.

                        the are, simply because after killing and forcing our Ancestors to their ABRAHAMIC RELIGIONS,
                        the brought to us bible and say " DON'T ADD, DON'T REMOVE AND DON'T QUESTION THERE GOD,, That is

                        Some cave in our land still today, you can found the hand writing written on a wall (handwriting
                        of God), you can also find the pyramid. Before I forget my ancient father's Believe that every
                        Human have a pyramid in him, that is the 7 chakra, in our land we called it EZU ME ZU.
                        The spirit that controls and guild man through the rest of his life. The can also destroy a Man

                        process of positive and negative everything was created, that while Christian called Lucifer
                        (devil) an negative angel, yeah because Lucifer was once and Angel of God of christian, before

                        AND INCARNATE = REINCARNATION" Then man will resonated in Ocean of Love and mercy with his own

                        In our land CHI is your guilding Angel, let me informed you about this, because is the secret
                        truth of our ancient religion. As human have different faces this is how there is different
                        CHI(God), on there different world, in the world (EARTH) also CHI IS CLASSIFIEDS IN DIFFERENT

                        everything in the world (Earth) have chi, has a guilding Angel, your chi have reincarnate in
                        world in different forms, like I said earlier about been in middle of four faces of mirrors,
                        that is how your chi is on the earth (law of reflect) you represent your own God(chi) in life
                        meanwhile your own CHI (God), represent you on heaven, Water or anything you called it. <br>
                        The law of karma (nature) say man must reap what he sow. Life exist only here on earth, then you
                        will return in any form to reap what you have sow here on earth, so you also coming back with
                        your own karma been agree with your chi, that you must reap,...
                        These is how our own ancient father's believe about judgement day.
